    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">I made a website for coders!</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">This website is meant to be for beginners</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">who are learning programming</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">The whole website is made by only one person</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">who is a 10 year old.</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">Here is how the journey of a 10 year old started...</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">When I was in 4th Grade, I decided to challenge myself</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">To make websites apps games.</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">At first, I thought it was the hardest challenge of my life.</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">But I was not afraid of anything.</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">I was confident in coding and not give up.</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">My First Programming Language was Java, a complicated language.</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">I used to watch videos of java tutorials, they were pretty easy for me</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">Then, I used to learn java by websites, they were easy too!</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">When I learnt the basics of java programming language</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">I moved on making games which were harder than java for me</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">I started by watching tutorials of how to make games</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">Then I learned the basics of making a game.</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">they were the hardest to make!</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">And then, i moved on other programming languages</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">Such as Python, R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">I learnt the basics of that programming languages</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">And There, I am now making websites of my own!</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">Quote:</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">If you think it hard, you will never be educated</p>
